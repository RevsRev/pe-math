# Project Euler Mathematics Library

This project serves as a mathematics library for tasks commonly appearing in Project Euler problems.

To begin with, this will mainly involve:
- Diophantine Equations
- Methods involving prime numbers

As the project grows, more content will be added where appropriate.
